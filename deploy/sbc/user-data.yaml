# cloud-init user-data template for Raspberry Pi running rt-forwarder.
#
# BEFORE FLASHING: Edit the two lines marked CHANGEME below.
#
# How to use:
#   1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit, Lite) with Raspberry Pi Imager
#   2. Edit this file (hostname + SSH key)
#   3. Copy this file to the SD card boot partition as "user-data"
#   4. Boot the Pi — cloud-init runs on first boot
#   5. SSH in and run rt-setup.sh to install the forwarder
#
# See deploy/sbc/README.md for full instructions.

  - default
  - name: rt-forwarder
